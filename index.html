                    Andrew Freeman is a technical support specialist at CPT Networks. He is currently in the process of switching careers into the coding world. Andrew discovered his passion for coding and has always found it fascinating on the development of building programs and websites. Andrew is a veteran of the United States Army. During his time in the military, he was deployed three times and two of those times was with JSOC (Joint Special Operations Command). During his military career he was elected to attend multiple advance courses for his field and was able to pass top of his class. A lot of the programs used in the military were outdated which made it difficult for Andrew to send intelligence reports more quickly and efficiently. This is what fueled his passion for coding.
